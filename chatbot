A chatbot is a software application used to conduct an on-line chat conversation via text or text-to-speech, in lieu of providing direct contact with a live human agent. 
Chatbots are typically used in dialog systems for various purposes including customer service, request routing, or for information gathering. 
While some chatbot applications use extensive word-classification processes, Natural Language processors, and sophisticated AI, others simply scan for general
keywords and generate responses using common phrases obtained from an associated library or database.
